# Yagols - Yet another Game of Life simulator

<br>

### Yagols is

  * Not a game.

  * A browser (canvas) implementation of the well-known simulation "Conway's Game of Life" (cellular automaton).
  
  * One big .html page with JavaScript and a bit of HTML/CSS. No further dependencies.
  
  * A bit of a hack... Clean code was not an objective of this project (learning Javascript/Canvas was). 
    So lots of good ol' procedural code, globals with funny names, functions which do multiple things,
    same code copied all over the place, etc.

<br>

### Features:

  * Smooth, intuitive and mode-less user interface with lots of feedback.

  * Keeps history of generations; works like a tape recorder (fast-forward, rewind).
  
  * Generations can be easiliy updated with other "on"/"off" cells. With undo option.
  
  * Generations that were updated are marked and can be easiliy found back.
  
  * "Infinite" universe in theory, in practice it's a toroidal plane 19,999,999 x 19,999,999.
  
  * Older cells get a darker color.
  
  * Drag sliders to zoom in/out or to change simulation speed.
  
  * Drag universe to change viewing area position.
    
  * Change GoL rule and add/remove cells on the fly.
  
  * Paste RLE formatted text to add patterns.
  
  * Helicopter view of all "on" cells in the universe fitted within the viewing area.
  
  * Everything happens real-time.
