# Yagols - Yet another Game of Life simulator

<br>

### Yagols is

  * Not a game.

  * A browser (canvas) implementation of the well-known simulation "Conway's Game of Life" (cellular automaton).
  
  * One .html page with mainly JavaScript and a bit of HTML/CSS. No further dependencies.
  
  * A work in progress . . .
  
  * And a bit of a hack... Clean code was not an objective of this project. So, lots of good ol' procedural
    code, globals and magic numbers galore, funny names, code fragments copied all over the place, etc.
    But it works.

### Features:

  * Intuitive and fluid user interface.
  
  * Ideal for beginning enthusiasts to easily explore and experiment GoL.

  * Generations are recorded. Works like a tape recorder (play / fast-forward / rewind).
  
  * Switch cells "on" or "off" and change the GoL rule on the fly.
  
  * The cells of a generation can be changed multiple times with unlimited undo.

  * Changed generations are marked and can be easiliy located.
  
  * Infinite universe, in theory, in practice a 19,999,999 x 19,999,999 toroidal plane.
  
  * Copy/paste RLE formatted text to add patterns.
  
  * If the pattern evolves into an oscillator or spaceship it is automatically detected.
  
  * Helicopter view of all "on" cells in the universe fitted within the viewing area.
  
  * Older cells get a darker color; number of colors (shades) is variable.
