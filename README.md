# Yagols v3.7 - Yet another Game of Life simulator

<br>

### Yagols is

  * Not a game.

  * A browser (canvas) implementation of the well-known simulation "Conway's Game of Life" (cellular automaton).

  * One .html page with mainly JavaScript and a bit of HTML/CSS. No further dependencies.

  * A WIP . . . And a hack . . .

## Features:

  * Intuitive and fluid user interface.

  * For beginning enthusiasts to easily explore and experiment with GoL.

  * Generations are recorded. Works like a tape recorder (play / fast-forward / rewind).

  * Switch cells "on" or "off" and change the GoL rule on the fly.

  * The cells of a generation can be changed multiple times with unlimited undo.

  * Changed generations are marked and can be easiliy found back to try something else.

  * Infinite universe, in theory, in practice a 19,999,999 x 19,999,999 toroidal plane.

  * Copy/paste RLE formatted text to add patterns.

  * If the pattern evolves into an oscillator or spaceship it is automatically detected.

  * Helicopter view of all "on" cells in the universe fitted within the viewing area.

  * Older cells get a darker color; number of colors (shades) is variable.
