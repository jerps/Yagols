### Features

* Intuitive and fluid user interface.

* For beginning enthusiasts to easily explore and experiment with GoL.

* Generations are recorded. Works like a tape recorder (play / fast-forward / rewind).

* Switch cells "on" or "off" and change the GoL rule on the fly.

* The cells of a generation can be changed multiple times with unlimited undo.

* Changed generations are marked and can be easiliy found back to try something else.

* Infinite universe, in theory, in practice a 19,999,999 x 19,999,999 toroidal plane.

* Copy/paste RLE formatted text to add patterns.

* If the pattern evolves into an oscillator or spaceship it is automatically detected.

* Helicopter view of all "on" cells in the universe fitted within the viewing area.

* Older cells get a darker color; number of colors (shades) is variable.
